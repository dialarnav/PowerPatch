    shortDescription: 'Design a solar microgrid for 200 students. Balance cost with reliability for uninterrupted learning.',
    storyline: `You're working with the Kisumu Rural Education Initiative to bring electricity to a primary school serving 200 students in rural Kenya. The school's headmaster, Grace Wanjiku, has been fighting for years to get reliable electricity for her students.

"Every evening when the sun sets, our children must stop learning," Grace tells you during your site visit. "With proper lighting and computer access, we could run evening classes for adults too. This isn't just about education - it's about breaking the cycle of poverty in our community."

The nearest power grid is 15 kilometers away, making connection costs prohibitive. Diesel generators are expensive to run and often break down. Your solar microgrid solution could transform this school and become a model for hundreds of others across Kenya.`,
    
    fullDescription: `The Kisumu Rural Education Initiative aims to electrify a primary school serving 200 students in rural Kenya. Currently, the school relies on kerosene lamps and candles after dark, limiting study hours and educational opportunities.`,
